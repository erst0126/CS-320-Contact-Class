How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?\n
I would say that for never using JUnit testing before, I did pretty okay. I did make some mistakes, but I learned a whole lot. JUnit tests are very useful in making sure that your program is running smoothly, and it accomplishes this by allowing you to create tests for each of the parameters in your program. They also allow you to see where errors are in your prgram, allowing you to quickly find them and correct them. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
When looking at user needs, it is important to make sure you write them down and read over them a few times. That one is kind of personal, so if you don't need that then you can skip that. You look at the user needs and think about how they fit into the program. For example, for the contact class the firstName field couldn't be more than a certain number of characters. All you need to do is think about how you would say that in code and then apply it.

How do I approach designing software?
I would say I try to make sure my software is easy to understand and performs really well with no errors. I make sure that my variable names are easy to read and that the meanings are obvious, as well as making sure that my code meets the design standard. Then, I would run tests as I am developing my code, I prefer to check each section as I code it in an attempt to catch errors earlier. To do this with a JUnit test, I would code the program and the test together, updating each one in unison.
